M.S. Computer Science @ Georgia Tech '24

### About me

I'm a computer science student at Georgia Tech who is interested in developing technology that solves real-world problems. My realm of experience lies in AWS Native Services. While interning at Fidelity Investments, I worked on developing highly-scalable cloud infrastructure and decreased cloud deployment time by over 17x. As a software engineer intern at Card Curator, I assisted in developing the application's proprietary back-end with the CTO to allow consumers to fully leverage their credit card rewards. Back home, I co-founded Scholastician, a student-run organization aimed at providing personalized tutoring by matching students to certified tutors, which received a Congressional Commendation by my local House Representative (TX-03) and was featured by local news channels. In my free time, I enjoy building projects and watching sports.

Prior to attending Tech, I also interned as a research assistant at the University of Texas at Austin under Dr. Xuesu Xiao where I improved the efficiency of path-planning for high-dimensional robotic arms using machine learning.

### Definition lists can be used with HTML syntax.

Long, single-line code blocks should not wrap. They should horizontally scroll if they are too long. This line should be long enough to demonstrate this.
